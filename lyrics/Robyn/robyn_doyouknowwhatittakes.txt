"Do You Know (What It Takes)"



Don't you know i can see what you're doing
Runnin' around with your cheap talk, cheap talk
What I need is a man who can do me right

If you got what I need I can gurarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you'll always be around
Do you know what it takes to love me?
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know what it takes to love me baby?

Heaven knows in my time I've been lonely
Feelin' my love echo in my mind, in my mind yeah
A never satisfied girl's what they call me
But I just can't keep goin' on livin' lies

Guarantee unto me, you won't let me down
There's so much I can give but it's buried so deep
I just got to be sure that you always will be around

[Chorus]
do you know what it takes?
do you know what it takes?

Don't waste my time with your lies (yeah baby, i gotta know)
You got to prove that you will always be around
I'll give you everything
Boy will you do the same for me?
Will you do anything? 
I gotta know what will it be
