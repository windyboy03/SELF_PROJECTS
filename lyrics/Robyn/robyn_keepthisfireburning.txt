"Keep This Fire Burning"



Alright'

Even when you don't know 
I'll be by your side
Even when you think you're all alone
I'll be by your side (hey ohh)

I'll be right behind you, keep on goin'
In which ever way the wind is blowing 
I will be there til the world stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

When nobody else is
I am on your side, oh yeah'
Baby when you're not even yourself
I am on your side (ohh)

I'll be right behind you, keep on goin'
In which ever way the wind is blowing 
I will be there till the world stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning fire

Even when you lost your faith in love
Even when there is no light above
Even when you wanna run and hide, yeah'

Ain't nobody stoppin' me
When it comes to you and me
When nothing's like it used to be
I'll keep it burning
