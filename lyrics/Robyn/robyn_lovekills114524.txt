"Love Kills"



If you're looking for love
Get a heart made of steel 'cus you know that love kills
Don't go messing with love
It'll hurt you for real, don't you know that love kills

Protect yourself, 'cus you'll wreck yourself
In this cold, hard world, so check yourself
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
'Til that one kind soul reveals itself
