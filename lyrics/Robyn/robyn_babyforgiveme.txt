"Baby Forgive Me"



Here come the night
In your eyes
Baby, be brave
Be wise
It's up to you
You do what you like, mmm
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try

Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me

(Won't you give it a chance, baby?)
Won't you give it a chance, baby?
Just one more try
One more try
Yeah, eh

You got the power
You set the price
But baby, be fair
Be nice
You say you want to be happy
Then you got to put your love on the line
Just let me make you smile again, baby
I know we can work it out
Yes, I know we can

Baby forgive me
Yeah
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
Baby forgive me
